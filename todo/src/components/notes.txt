Dumb components:
***************
Dumb components are also called ‘presentational’ components because their only responsibility is to present something to the DOM. Once that is done, the component is done with it. 
Nope. Put the info on the page and move on.
A ‘hello world’ component can be thought of as the most basic dumb component. 
Or entire sections of a website such as a header or footer. 
The component can be written in one place and used several times throughout the app, just rendering it’s heart out, and each instance of that component will look the same.


smartcomponents:
****************
Smart components (or container components) on the other hand have a different responsibility.
 Because they have the burden of being smart, they are the ones that keep track of state and care about how the app works.
The container components do the heavy lifting and pass the data down to the presentational components as props.
The root component off an app is a good example of a smart component.

Higher order components:
************************
Higher-order components (HOCs) in React were inspired by higher-order functions in JavaScript.
A HOC is an advanced technique for reusing logic in React components. 
It is a pattern created out of React’s compositional nature.

HOCs basically incorporate the don’t-repeat-yourself (DRY) principle of programming, 
which you’ve most likely come across at some point in your career as a software developer. 
It is one of the best-known principles of software development, and observing it is very important when building an application or writing code in general.

example
Higher-order functions in JavaScript take some functions as arguments and return another function. 
higher-order functions are the following:

.forEach()
This iterates over every element in an array with the same code, but does not change or mutate the array, and it returns undefined.
.map()
This method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements, and then building a new array from the returned values.
.reduce()
This method executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left to right).
.filter()
This checks every single element in an array to see whether it meets certain criteria as specified in the filter method, and then it returns a new array with the elements that match the criteria.

What Is A Higher-Order Component? 
A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced element for reusing logic in React components.
Components take one or more components as arguments, and return a new upgraded component.
